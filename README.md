# NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Stock-Price-Prediction
UC Davis STA141B Course Data Science Project (in Python)

This project is mainly focusing on studying the influence of news headlines on the stock price movements. It started with web-scrapping stock price data from Yahoo Finance and stock news headlines from Financial Visualization for the companeis of interest. Data preprocessings and cleanings were performed on the stock price data, while text preprocessing and sentiment analysis were conducted for the news healines data. Afterwards, the sentiment value was generated by using TextBlob and NLTK-Valder Lexicon tools. Classification models, such as logistic regression, SVM (Support-vector Machine), and random forest were trained and tuned on the data for predicting stock movements. Lastly, model accuracies were compared from different models using the test data.
